      <description>Challenge to J. S. Mill&amp;rsquo;s Utilitarianism  Why is justice the chief part and the most binding part of our morality? Is it the only reason to respect other people&amp;rsquo;s rights that respecting people&amp;rsquo;s rights is a way of making everybody better off in the long run?  Libertarianism The fundamental idea: Individuals matter not just as instruments to be used for a larger social purpose or for the sake of maximizing utility, individuals are separate beings with separate lives worthy of respect.</description>

&amp;ndash;Jeremy Bentham
 Is it right to refuse to make qualitative distinctions? Can we dispense with the idea that certain things we take pleasure in are better or worthier than others?</description>
