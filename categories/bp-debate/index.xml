      <description>Extension What is an extension? An extension is a new contribution of material put forward by closing teams that aims to be the most important material in the context of the debate.
An extension can be radically new piece of material, or it can take an existing piece of material and developed further. It is basically anything new.
Teams can run multiple points of extension, and these points can be new substantive or new rebuttal (in the same way a second speaker might make a piece of rebuttal into a new pint of substantive).</description>
